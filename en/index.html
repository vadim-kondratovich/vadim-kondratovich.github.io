                Kondratovich Vadim (aka Zhukovsky Vadim). Company SNV-GROUP sp.
                z o.o. This person changed his last name ... strange, why?!?!
              </p>
              <p>
                Kondratovich Vadim caused me significant financial damage as a
                builder and expert. I was very unlucky to meet this deceiver and
                swindler when I decided to build a house. He ingratiated
                himself. The behavior pattern of a true fraudster: he agrees to
                everything, understands, and even shows some initiative from the
                depth of false experience in construction (he lies that he has
                worked in construction for more than 15 years). But the goal of
                this person is to take money from you. And then construction
                begins and you realize that there is no understanding and
                knowledge of technical standards. The absolute absence of
                control over the work process, although he pretends to come and
                check on what's going on.
              </p>
              <p>
                And most importantly, this person refuses to fix all his
                mistakes in his work! But when there is no knowledge, then there
                is no idea how to fix it. And because of greed for money, this
                company uses the cheapest builders.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the construction of a 2-story building, this DECIEVER
                made the following mistakes:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    When pouring the foundation.The norms of work and grade of
                    concrete were not observed. The foundation subsequently
                    cracked in several places. As it was later concluded by
                    experts, the norms of concrete work and the technical
                    properties of concrete were not observed. And the main thing
                    - the volume of consumed concrete and the volume of
                    purchased concrete - were significantly different.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Errors in calculations during the construction of a concrete
                    staircase from the first to the second floor. This situation
                    was fraudulently hidden by Kondratovich Vadim as a
                    construction manager. In order not to pay the costs of
                    rebuilding this element of the house.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Mistakes in the calculations of building a bathroom on the
                    2nd floor. It was withheld. Problems with #2 led to problems
                    with #3 (bathroom).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Roof. Complete sloppiness in the process of building a roof.
                    Not knowing simple basics and not wanting to spend time
                    controlling the process. Lack of insulation in critical
                    places. And at the same time - an overestimate. Kondratovich
                    overestimated (stole) the volume of the necessary material
                    (heater). The entire roof needed to be redone now by a
                    different company.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    For some reason, the water well in my area turned out to be
                    deeper than all the other water wells on the street, by
                    about 30 percent. He, as a construction manager, invited a
                    contractor and they drilled more depth than necessary. And
                    he also took money for the entire volume of work. Overpriced
                    and theft.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Kondratovich Vadim is familiar with the whole range of problems
                created by him and his construction team. The behavior of
                Kondratovich Vadim (formerly Zhukovsky Vadim) is fully
                consistent with a dishonorable person - a deceiver: "The
                builders are to blame for everything, but I have nothing to do
                with it." And this is the head of the company! And also when
                changing the place of residence, this person changes his surname
                from Zhukovsky to Kondratovich. It becomes clear that there are
                many more similar cases with construction and other people. At
                the moment, this multi-surname specialist refuses to fix all the
                problems he caused at his own expense.
              </p>
              <p>The further process moves in the legal direction.</p>
